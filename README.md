Learning the fundamentals of 3D Engine Programming with javidx9 youtube tutorial. 

## Part 1

Part 1 is just a cube rotating. In this part I learned about translating 3D objects to a 2D screen with projection.

## Part 2

Part 2 adds visibility, displaying only the parts of the objects that are in front of the camera. To identify those part we use the scalar product of the normal and the line casted from the viewing position to the normal. We then use the painter's algorithm to draw the triangles.
